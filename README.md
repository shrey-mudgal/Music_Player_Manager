# Music_Player_Manager
This project implements a Music Playlist Manager in C++ using a singly linked list. The playlist allows users to dynamically manage songs with the following functionalities:

Add Songs: Insert a new song at the end of the playlist, including the title and artist's name.
Delete Songs: Remove a specific song from the playlist by its title.
Display Playlist: View all songs in the playlist in their current order.
Shuffle Playlist: Randomly rearrange the order of the songs in the playlist.
Dynamic Memory Management: The project ensures efficient memory handling using pointers and properly cleans up resources when the playlist is no longer needed.
The linked list structure enables flexible and efficient management of the playlist without predefining its size. This project highlights the use of pointers, data structures, and object-oriented programming concepts, such as constructors, destructors, and dynamic allocation.

The project is a great demonstration of understanding core programming fundamentals and applying them to solve real-world problems like managing playlists!
